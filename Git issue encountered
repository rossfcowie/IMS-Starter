at about 11:30 Friday 19th Feburary I started to try and git merge my itemfunctionality branch into develop, along with my OrderFunctionality branch, however git assumed 
that the develop branch was already up to date despite not having any of the files needed for ItemFunctionality.  After attempting to sort this, and meeting little sucess 
a new branch ItemFunctionalityGitFix was made with the files being added to that one and merged into develop.

Numerous reverts and resets were attempted but ultimately the final merge was done by backuing up deleting the files for Itemfunctionality and Orderfunctionality and updating
both branches back to develop's current state, then committing all of the back up files back into their respective branches before merging both into develop.
